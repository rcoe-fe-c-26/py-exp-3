# AIM: Calculating Gross Salary of an Employee: 
Write a Python program to calculate the gross salary of an employee. The
program should prompt the user for the basic salary (BS) and
then compute the dearness allowance (DA) as 70% of BS, the
travel allowance (TA) as 30% of BS, and the house rent
allowance (HRA) as 10% of BS. Finally, it should calculate
the gross salary as the sum of BS, DA, TA, and HRA and
display the result.

**Input:** 
```
Enter Basic Salary: 5000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Salary Details:
Basic Salary:    5000.0
DA (70%):        3500.0
TA (30%):        1500.0
HRA (10%):       500.0
Gross Salary:    10500.0
```

**Tip:**

To put the numbers in the same columns use `\t` in the print statements.
